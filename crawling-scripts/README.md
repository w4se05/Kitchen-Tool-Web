# Kitchen-To-Ol
A creepy and sneaky web crawling bot (not rilly a chatbot like other dudes in my Github, but still a bot - don't ban me Microsoft).
## I. Guide:
### 1. Installing:
#### a. To setup this shi (Windows):
- You must ```cd``` into the Kitchen-To-Ol root dir in your computer first!
```
python -m venv venv # Watever Python is fine
"./venv/Scripts/activate.bat"
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
#### b. To run (in Kitchen-To-Ol root dir):
- Command (Window):
```
"./venv/Scripts/activate.bat"
python crawl_web_script/main.py --max_scroll 25 --n_img 1000 "muỗng gỗ" "wooden spoon" "wooden spoons for cooking"
```
- Guide:
    + Use "python crawl_web_script/main.py -h" to get more info
    + Overall, change the ```1000``` on the command above to change the number of image
- For Linux shi, look on Google, but the gist is the same (change the effing ```"./venv/Scripts/activate.bat"``` to something Penguin-like).
### 2. Trivia:
- Run ```.ipynb``` file to avoid the loss of links when the file crashes. It is made carefully and steadfastly (as I am obviously so great and mightiful, whatever). However, lest your peasant's pc or Internet got some error, you wouldn't be destroying your own pc out of wroth.
- Some changes regarding the Google Image's class would occur. Use F12 to check for them if there are some errors (throw this to the high elf called ChatGPT to ask for guidance).
## Other things:
- Nothing for now. Enjoy it.
